# Can Jump II

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/

### Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

The original problem assumes that the input is always possible. However, I decided to return -1 in cases that it is impossible.
